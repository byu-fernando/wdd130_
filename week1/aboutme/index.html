    <p>Hello Everyone. I am from Florianópolis, Brazil. 
    It is a city located in the south of Brazil. Here is a very hot place,
    we have more than 30 beaches, in the summer we receive tourists from all over the world,
    but especially Argentinians. </p>
    <p>Currently,I'm working in the area of ​​technology in the city hall of my city and 
    I'm also attending two colleges of technology. I am very excited and looking forward to the start of classes at BYU Idaho 
    because I am sure I will learn a lot this semester. I can't wait to start making websites. 
    </p>
    <p>I am very excited about the course. I am pleased to meet all my colleagues. 
    Thank you very much for reading my page. Good luck to all of us.</p>
